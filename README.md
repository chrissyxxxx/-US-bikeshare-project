# -US-bikeshare-project
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience for the user to present these statistics and answering interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
